<b>Lyndhardtia burns.</b> The Kingdom is in upheavel, after the death of Queen Alyssana. Four claimants lay claim. Only one will remain.
<br>
<br>
Thousands of years ago, the Pantheon bestowed mortalkind with the realm of Beowricke, of which the continent of Llewyn resides. Of which Lyndhardtia resides. The Kingdom of Lyndhardtia is a juggernaut of strength, one at its peak, overseeing vast swathes of the continent and tributary states.
<br>
But times change.
<br>
<br>
The Golden Age was a great period in the Kingdom's years, guided by the Mother Church of the Pantheon, brought unprecedented peace and prosperity across Llewyn. But everything changed with the death of Queen Alyssana. When the Queen died without an heir, it brought the realm to its knees, with four claimants declaring themselves King.
<br>
<br>
Baleron, Vladislav, Laurence, and Gunthard have all amassed their powerbases, and their levies, and have been at eachother's throats for years. The civil war has raged for too long. Death, despair, disease, and worse slowly chokes the life out of Lyndhardtia. Enemies begin picking apart the carcasses, as others prepare for the inevitable collapse of order.
<br>
<br>
Lyndhardtia is dying; scent of shit and pus and maggot-filth in the air. The Mother Church attempts to hold solidified control of the realm, but new evils arise. With a resurgence of chaos, cultists of the daemonic deities have begun to re-amass themselves. Orders from darkness begin to resurface, once thought extinct. Whispered murmurs speak of ZIZO, a return to daes of destruction not seen since the Bloodwake.

<br>
<b>Children of the Pantheon, the Kingdom of Lyndhardtia is tearing itself apart, destruction runs rampant, and evil resurfaces-</b> will you lose your faith in the Ten that have guided and nurtured you?
<br>
<b>Ambitious cultists, worshippers of the daemonic, and even darker-</b> will you rise up and remake this land in your image, bringing subjugation and compliance?
<br>
<b>Holy Lamb, Sacrificial Hero, Blessed Idiot, The Dead God endures-</b> will you yet persist as stoically and wilfully as he does, for all of humenkind?
<br>
<b>Lowly fool- will you survive the oncoming storm?</b>
